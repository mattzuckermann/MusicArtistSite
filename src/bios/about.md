Josh Zuckermann is an eclectic artist from Illinois and a recent graduate with a B.M. in Music Composition from the Wheaton College (IL) Conservatory of Music.

Josh plays a wide variety of musical genres, including: classical, jazz, rap, R&B, rock, pop, and folk. He utilizes a combination of guitar, piano, and bass with electronic production to produce R&B and pop tracks. He is a singer, rapper, and songwriter whose production contains multiple layers to create an expansive sonic atmosphere. His music draws inspiration from Frank Ocean, Daniel Caesar, and Childish Gambino, and he crafts a wholistic vision of the music as he writes, performs, and records everything himself. In April 2020, he released I Want to Feel, the lead single to his upcoming album, *Awakening*, coming out in November.
